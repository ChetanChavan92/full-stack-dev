# Week 5 - Day 3
# Introduction to Data Structures

**What is a data structure?**

According to wikipedia, "In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification".

**What does this mean?**

As programmers we create data structures to represent real world data like bank accounts, social relationships, maps etc. 

We do this so that we can efficiently manage data on a computer, efficiently access data and efficiently modify this data.

### There are 2 types of data structures:

***Linear:*** A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.

**Examples:**

- Arrays
- Lists
- Stack
- Set
- Queue

***Non-linear:*** A data structure is said to be non-linear if its elements do not form a sequence. 

**Examples:**

- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash-based structures

There are many different data structures as you can see and they all store and manipulate data in different ways. We have to start somewhere to lets start with an easy data structure.

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that has 3 important operations/methods:

- **push** which adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop** which removes an element from the top of the stack and returns it.
- **peek** which looks at the top of stack but doesn't remove any element. 

A stack looks like what a stack of any objects looks like.

In the above image you can only add or remove rocks from the top of the stack.

In much the same way you can `push` data to the top of the stack and then `pop` data from the top of the stack.

Stacks are also known as a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure due to the nature of `push` and `pop`.
