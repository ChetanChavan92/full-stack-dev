### Week 4 - Day 5

## Project Day

Design and implement a project picked by you!

For all the API's you need to **sign up** on the website and get the API key. 

It looks something like this `$2a$10$Tu9pmPwtr.huHjGV99ykB.Xb2eIQHnbuK/hfAqIKCe6BllB7gY/MW`. This looks like a bunch of random characters but computers can understand this!

Once you have the API key you can try different routes on your browser and then try them in your program.

All projects are based on your creativity but, follow the guidelines below.

**Guidelines:**

- You must use 2 or more routes/features from the API!
- Your webpage must contain images/icons. Make it look presentable.  
- Write base structure of your webpage in HTML/CSS.
- Use JavaScript to get data from the API and then append elements after you get some data.
- Many API's limit the number of requests you can make to the server. Do not make more than 1000 requests. Do not put your request in a Loop!
