#### Assignment

**SUBMISSION:**

- Pull the `cohort_1` repo
- Go to `assignments/week_4/day_4` 
- Make a folder called `firstname_lastname` with your own first name and last name. 
- **Within** that folder create a file called `index.html` and a file called `index.js`. 
- Once you are done with the coding session push that folder to the online repo. 

**JavaScript (Part 9)**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** You have only been given a basic HTML file. YOU MUST FILL`id` `class` and other basic attributes for all tags! You must also define your own JavaScript Functions!  

**NOTE4:** You must not write any JavaScript code within the `index.html`file! ***All*** your JS must be in the `index.js` file! Use the script tag to link your JS file from your HTML file. 

**NOTE5:** Only attempt the bonus questions once you have finished the basic questions. 

### FSD.W4.4.A (1 Hour)

Using HTML design a page similar to the mock up image! [https://github.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/blob/master/course/week_4/day_4/day4coding.png](https://github.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/blob/master/course/week_4/day_4/day4coding.png)

**Using JavaScript Do the following:**

1. A JSON file with an array of objects is given in this link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/master/course/week_4/day_4/citiesMini.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/master/course/week_4/day_4/citiesMini.json)
2. It consists of the names of cities and towns and their latitude and longitude. It is only the names of cities and towns in India and U.S.A.
3. Store this in a global variable for later use. Make sure you `JSON.parse` it before you try and retrieve values.
4. After the name of a city or town is entered and the submit button is clicked, you must display the weather for that town.
5. If the city or town name that is entered is invalid or not present in the JSON, you must send and alert with the message `Invalid input or city/town not found!`

### FSD.W4.4.A (Bonus 1)

Lets add an additional feature to your project. 

When the webpage is opened, it must automatically retrieve the browsers location and display the local weather data!

If you aren't sure how to find a browsers location read this [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

### FSD.W4.4.A (Bonus 2)

Storing large JSON's can get messy and we really only have data for two countries! 

Instead of getting your latitude and longitude from a variable, get it from another api!

The [https://geocode.xyz/api](https://geocode.xyz/api) API does this for you very easily. Read its documentation carefully!

Feel free to use any HTML and JavaScript you want for this project.
